## About the challenge

Link to layout file can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1odVI0RZrai1PLyajf0w3sWMz9TTGTsWR/view?usp=sharing

This is a pretty simple test, in which you should be able to write a React app, using the provided screens as reference. Youâ€™ll need to make requests to an API to get some JSON content, filter the data and print it on view.

You can use any boilerplate/approach you prefer, but try to keep it simple. We encourage you to use your favourite tools and packages to build a solid React application.

### The app should be a movie search with two pages:

* **Home page:** search field and a list with the results;

  _Think about empty state, loading state and movie not found_

* **Movie page:** movie details page;

  _Think about loading state and movie not found_

The purpose of this challenge is to evaluate your HTML, CSS, Javascript and React API skills and overall approach while composing a simple web app given a set of screens and an API feed. We will also assess the HTML, CSS, and JS output.

## Getting Started

1.  Fork this repository to your personal account;
2.  Create a branch with your name;
3.  Solve the challenge in the best way you can;

**Send us your code in a zip file**

### Tips

* Write a good README with basic information (e.g.: how to start the project and how to build it);
* There's no screens designed for the mobile version, but if you build a responsive app it's a big plus. We would love to see your design skills as well!
* Feel free to work and improve on the available designs. Think of them as guidelines.
* There's a "like" button on the details page. It would be great if this information is persistent!
* Prefer to use a css methodology, such as BEM, ITCSS, etc;
* Use any CSS extension like LESS or SASS;
* Asking questions is good. We will not penalize you for asking questions;
* The API server is sometimes slow, so think about loading and empty states throughout your application;
* We're looking for signs you understand concepts such as events, promises, and reactivity, and how those concepts are implemented in Javascript;
* Unit testing will be greatly valued;
* The git history will be evaluated;
* Your code will be evaluated by: semantics, structure, legibility, size, elegance (among other factors);

### Necessary information
